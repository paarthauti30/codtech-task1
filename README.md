**Overview of the Project**
**Project**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The aim is to uncover insights into the relationships between different features, distributions, and potential patterns through visualizations.

**Key Activities**

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
Data Exploration: Displaying the first few rows and basic information about the dataset.
Missing Values Check: Identifying and handling any missing values in the dataset.
Duplicate Check: Checking for and removing any duplicate entries in the dataset.
