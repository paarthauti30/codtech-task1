Overview of the Project
Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The aim is to uncover insights into the relationships between different features, distributions, and potential patterns through visualizations.

Key Activities

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
Data Exploration: Displaying the first few rows and basic information about the dataset.
Missing Values Check: Identifying and handling any missing values in the dataset.
Duplicate Check: Checking for and removing any duplicate entries in the dataset.
Technologies Used

Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Employed for numerical operations and handling arrays.
Key Insights

Data Structure Understanding: Initial exploration provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and features.
Data Quality Assessment: Identifying missing values and duplicates helps ensure the integrity of the dataset for further analysis.
Preparation for Visualization: Cleaned data sets the stage for subsequent visualizations and deeper analysis.
This project provides a foundational understanding of the Iris dataset, paving the way for more advanced analyses and visualizations related to flower species classification and characteristics.
